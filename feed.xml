<h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">I receive offers for my property all the time, why should I choose The Upstate Land Company?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>I have a unique focus on the upstate NY market and I am dedicated to providing you the best possible seller experience.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a cost for your services?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>No.  There is no cost to get an offer on your property.  And if we make a deal, I'll cover all the closing costs and fees associated with the sale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't want to submit my property through this site, can I call instead?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely.  You can call any time at (315) 556-8899.  You may have to leave a message but I'll get back to you quickly.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you do with my property once you buy it?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Most properties will be resold.  I may retain a few properties in my long term investment portfolio. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you going to give me top dollar for my property?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>No.  You would probably get a higher price selling it with a realtor.  However, that can be a slow and occasionally frustrating process.  My goal is to provide you with a fast and painless process so you get the cash you need... and <em>stop</em> the expenses associated with owning land you <em>don't</em> need!</li>
</ul>

<p>As an upstate New York resident, landowner, and land investor, I know a <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">little bit about the unique situation we face here.  New York state regulations and taxes can be burdensome. Real estate sales can be slow. Winters can slow thing</span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">s down even more. When I started this company I wanted to focus on the unique needs of the people who own land here. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">I have always loved land, maps, and the outdoors.  When I was younger I worked in agriculture and construction but my recent career has involved computing technology. I love helping people reach their goals, and I love stretching myself to see what I can accomplish. This business combines those skills and values.</span></p>
<p>I live in the Adirondack foothills in northern New York with my wife Jo and several pets.  I have never had children of my own, so philanthropy is my "why".  My big goal in life is to be able to donate lots of money to worthy causes.  </p>
<p>I look forward to showing you how you can get cash for your land to help you reach your goals.  </p>
